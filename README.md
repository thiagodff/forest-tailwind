[Forest](https://thiagodff.github.io/forest-tailwind/) is a project created for learning and experimenting with Tailwind v4.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS v4:** CSS framework with utility-first approach.
- **Directives:** Utilizing Tailwind's `@apply`, `@layer`, `@theme`, `@utility` directives to organize and extend the CSS.
- **HTML5:** For the structural markup of the website.
- **Javascript:** To change some html content.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thiagodff/forest-tailwind
cd forest-tailwind
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the Development Server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the Tailwind CSS CLI in watch mode. It will automatically process your `input.css` file and generate the `output.css` file whenever you make changes.
